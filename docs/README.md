## System Architecture

### Overview
The NBA Prediction System is built with a modular architecture that separates data collection, processing, modeling, and prediction generation.

### Components
- **Data Collection**: Scripts for fetching NBA statistics and betting odds
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering and data cleaning
- **Model Training**: XGBoost model development and validation
- **Prediction Generation**: Real-time game predictions and betting recommendations

## Data Pipeline

### Data Sources
- NBA API for game statistics
- Sportsbook odds data
- Advanced metrics from various sources

### Processing Steps
1. Raw data collection
2. Data cleaning and validation
3. Feature engineering
4. Model input preparation

## Model Development

### Feature Engineering
- Rolling statistics
- Opponent-adjusted metrics
- Game context features

### Model Architecture
- XGBoost for classification and regression
- Ensemble methods for improved accuracy
- Confidence scoring system

## API Reference

### Data Fetching
```python
from scripts.fetch import fetch_nba_data

# Fetch game data
games = fetch_nba_data(start_date='2025-01-01', end_date='2025-01-31')
```

### Feature Engineering
```python
from scripts.process import engineer_features

# Create features
features = engineer_features(data, windows=[3, 5, 10])
```

### Model Prediction
```python
from scripts.predict import generate_predictions

# Generate predictions
predictions = generate_predictions(games)
```

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)
- API keys for data sources

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run the data pipeline
5. Train the models
6. Start the prediction service

### Monitoring
- Log files in `logs/`
- Performance metrics in `output/metrics/`
- Model evaluation reports
